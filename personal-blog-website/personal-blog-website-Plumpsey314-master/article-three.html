    <p><span><b>Q:</b></span> “How great Luo’s talent was! He was able to electrify an audience by means of perfectly timed voice-over, even when overcome by a violent out of malaria.” (40)
      <p><span><b>Q:</b></span> What does this quote tell the reader about Luo?</p>
      <p class="indent"><span><b>C:</b></span>
        pattern of perseverance shown by this quote reverberates Luo’s strong will. The quote shows that Luo “overcame the horrors of malaria” and still did what he was supposed to do. The author, Dai, shows that he is very impressed. He means that
        Luo will not give up; when Dai says, “How great his talent was,” he was not talking about retelling a movie but about his perseverance fighting through malaria, reeducation and overall life. Although Dai showed that he was impressed by Luo’s
        storytelling skills, he has said that many times throughout the book; this is the first time that Luo is telling a story while sick, and that is why he is so impressed and the tone is so surprising. The author is ultimately getting at the
        importance of perseverance and working fighting and struggling to live and do what you are supposed to. This quote tells us about Luo’s courage reciting a movie while his teeth may be chattering and his health might be poor, while still doing
        a great job. The wording the author used for this passage is meant to inspire people to do great things even if they have disadvantages because the impossible is possible.
