    What is the criteria for a good quality of life? This question has many answers, for there are many variables in determining the best life. There is health, safety, happiness, lifespan, and many mare things that control one’s quality of life.
    Leisure time and education are very crucial parts that are necessary in order to have a good quality of life. During the Industrial revolution in England, from the late 18th century to the early 20th century, these vital parts of a person’s
    qualities of life were sometimes inaccessible. The privileges of leisure and education for the individuals of the working class in England increased from the first part to the second part of the Industrial Revolution. This is shown by the
    increased, income of the workers, child education and free time, in the second part of the Industrial Revolution.
    The owners of mills and factories have a desire to pay their workers only enough to have them work at their factories, and not a penny more in order to make as much money as possible. This resulted in things such as extreme poverty. In his
    description, Friedrich Engel described the factory his father works at as a hellish and disgusting place; he says the workers are the poorest of poor, for they get paid practically nothing for the hard work they do. (Spodek 572) This shows the
    horrible quality of life and said horrendously low individual wages in the first part of the Industrial Revolution. The payments were not at all fair and made it impossible for the working class to afford to buy any leisure activities. At the end
    of the first part of the Industrial Revolution, work was more labor intensive, and many other men, who were usually farmers or immigrants, demanded a higher price for their work, for they had more physical strength, as they entered the industry
    business; reluctantly, factories did give the men a higher pay (574 Spodek). This caused men to have more money, in order to be economically comfortable enough to spend money on leisure activities. During the beginning of the second phase of the
    Industrial Revolution, The lowest paying wage for men in a silk factory was 22 cents and hour.(Mill Work Data) At first glance, this might still seem low, which it is. This is, however the lowest paying job in the entire mill, and all other jobs
    have a higher pay. This low paying job in the second phase of the Industrial Revolution, still, far surpassed the job of Friedrich Engel’s father. With this money, the workers in the later phase of the Industrial Revolution had an opportunity to
    spend their money on leisure activities, ultimately leading to a more complete life..
    Because of the unfair wages of the workers during the first phase of the industrial revolution, the workers needed more money, so they sent their kids to work long hours just like them, getting paid just as little as they did. As the author of a
    child labor website began talking about the organization of child education, she states, that young children in the early 19th century, work 16 hours every day in unimaginably disgusting areas. (The Victorian Web/ Child Labor) With this non-stop
    work of this poor child, the child does not have time to get and education, or feel the joys of being a child. The child was also put in danger by working in unsanitary, and cramped spaces. The government, then took control, realizing the low
    quality of life these factories made children have, and limited the right of the factory to hire children under nine years old for the safety of the next generation (573 Spodek). This benefited the safety and wellbeing of the child. With this
    free time the child had he/she can go to school to get an education, When the author of a child labor website was explaining why it was an economic requirement for some children to work in factories, she states how, in 1840, only about a fifth of
    children got any sort of formal education, but that number grew to about a half by 1860. (The Victorian Web/ Child Labor) The education level of the children has greatly increased form the end of the first phase to the very beginning of the
    second phase of the Industrial Revolution. Education is a trait that is respected, so the increased education of the working class from the first phase to the second phase of the Industrial Revolution made the working class more respectable and
    power. This increased importance given to the working class has lead to an improved quality of life.
    Although money is important for leisure time, if someone does not have time to spare, they will not have any leisure time. When he was describing his life, and the stop and end times of his shift, at the mill, John Birley said, “Our regular time
    was from five in the morning till nine or ten at night; and on Saturday, till eleven and often even twelve o'clock and then we were sent to clean the machinery on Sunday.” (The Ashton Chronicle {19th May, 1849}.) This schedule has no time, at
    all, for anything aside from work. This lifestyle of no free time was a necessary evil because of the lack of money the workers had in this part of the Industrial Revolution. The British government realized that it would be better to expand their
    citizens’ quality of life at the expense of slightly decreasing the enormous economy of Britain, so they passed a law called, The Ten Hour Law; this law does not allow anyone to work for more that ten hours on a factory each day (573 Spodek).
    This law allowed people enough time do get an appropriate amount of sleep, eat meals, and spend leisure time with their family on a work day. This more relaxing schedule should increase the quality of life. When the author of an article about
    leisure activities in the Industrial Revolution was talking about fun sports the working class plays, thay mention, that soccer is a very popular sport amongst all people of all classes of the Industrial Revolution, and it is a fun leisure
    activity that uses teamwork. Soccer is a good example of how the working class was able to have fun and be seen as equals (The Victorian Web/The Development of Leisure in Britain after 1850). For this to happen, the working class must have to
    have time off of work, so this shows that the working class had time that was theirs during the second part of the Industrial Revolution. This extra free time, immensely improved the working class's quality of life for workers gives them a mental
    and physical break, and giving them leisure time to have more fun.
    During the late Industrial Revolution, the quality of life and child education increased. People were more sympathetic, realizing the difficult scenarios and hurdles of the working class. This was the ending of the caste system in Europe and the
    beginning of equality and a malleable and fair social ramp that is easier to climb that he steep, old social ladder.. The Industrial Revolution was really where connections were made between different socioeconomic classes and friendships were
    made based off of personality, not personal background.
