# Personal Blog Website

## Introduction
This project requires you to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

## Part One: Clone, Branch, and Import Project 
Begin by cloning the provided project, creating your dev branch, and importing it into your workspace. 

```
git clone <url for github repository>
```

After cloning this repository you want to run these commands, you want to cd into your repository

```
cd <name of github repository>
```

Then run these commands

```
cp pre-commit .git/hooks
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
