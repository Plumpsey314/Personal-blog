    <p>The protagonist, the main character, is always the ’good guy;’ they always save the day and everyone lives happily ever after. There are some stories, however, with different types of heroes such as anti heroes or tragic heroes. According to
      study.com, an educational database, an anti hero is a protagonist of a story who clearly lacks heroic attributes. There are clearly many of these traits, but “determination, courage, selfless[ness], compassion, and perseverance” are some
      important ones according to Dane Wallace, a professor at Missouri State University. An antihero shares some characteristics but is ultimately different from a tragic hero who, according to study.com, is a protagonist who experiences “one major
      or fatal flaw” leading to that hero’s demise. In Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Macbeth is seen transforming from a praised noble to a “tyrant” (4.3.214). Through the juxtaposition between Macbeth at the beginning and the end of the story,
      Macbeth’s unheroic characteristics portrayed during the play, and how Macbeth’s evil indirectly causes his downfall, Shakespeare portrays Macbeth as not only an anti-hero but as someone who is evil.</p>
    <p>As the protagonist, Macbeth changes throughout the play. When Macbeth is first mentioned by the nobles, they describe him as having heroic attributes and being good: “What [Cawdor] hath lost, Noble Macbeth hath won” (1.2.78). Duncan’s comment
      about Macbeth causes the reader to see him as a hero and a savior. The praise Duncan gives Macbeth is a tactic Shakespeare uses in order to juxtapose him from at the beginning of the play to him at the end in order to emphasize his change.
      Although Macbeth seems extremely heroic at the beginning of the play, at the end of the text, Macbeth is portrayed in the exact opposite way. When Young Siward is talking to Macbeth and Macbeth introduces himself, Young Siward says “The devil
      himself could not pronounce a title/ More hateful to mine ear” (5.7.10-11). Young Siward is so disgusted by Macbeth’s evil actions that even the name, Macbeth, is “hateful to [his] ear.” The contempt Young Siward shows how Macbeth is feared and
      how he has evil and non-heroic attributes. It is clear that Macbeth changes from a savior to someone so evil that his name is cursed, which is how Shakespeare uses juxtaposition to show Macbeth as a villain and as an antihero.</p>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of an antihero is that they lack heroic traits; one such characteristic is selflessness. After Macbeth is warned of Macduff, he encounters the second Apparition, who says Macbeth is invincible to everyone not born
      of a woman, (4.1.90-92) Macbeth states, “Then live, Macduff, what need I fear of thee?”(4.1.93) Macbeth was going to kill Macduff, but he did not just because according to Macbeth, Macduff will not pose a threat to him. When Macbeth explains
      why Macduff should live: “what need I fear of thee?” he reveals the only reason Macduff will live is because Macbeth does not need to kill him in order to protect his power. Since Macbeth would be willing to kill someone only in order to
      protect his power, Macbeth is shown to value himself and what he wants over human lives. Prioritizing one self like how Macbeth does shows that Macbeth is not only not selfless like an antihero would be, but selfish like a villain. Macbeth
      devaluing human lives and only thinking about himself and what he wants show that Macbeth is someone evil. When Macbeth was about to enter to meet the witches and see the Apparitions, the second witch states, “By the pricking of my thumbs,/
      Something wicked hs way comes” (4.1.44-45). The witches call Macbeth “wicked.” Since the witches have a supernatural ability to see the future and are often used as foreshadowing techniques, this statement has a lot of truth. As foreshadowing,
      Macbeth being called “wicked” means that Shakespeare is portraying Macbeth as becoming more evil as the play progresses. The clear lack of heroic attributes Shakespeare portrays, with dialogue that shows Macbeth possessing the exact opposite of
      heroic attributes and even calls Macbeth wicked, the polar opposite of a hero, that Macbeth absolutely lacks all heroic qualities and is clearly an antihero as well as someone evil. </p>
    <p>It may seem plausible, at first, that Macbeth is not evil, but a mere victim of his tragic flaws of ambition. Macbeth kills Duncan in order to become king, and Macbeth’s ambition leads him to the judgement error of killing more people in order
      to protect his power leading to a downward spiral of his demise, which is a classic example of a tragic hero. There are, however, a few details that make this argument invalid: A tragic hero is characterized by having one single fatal flaw
      leading to their downfall. Killing people is certainly Macbeth’s flaw causing his downfall, but Macbeth kills a lot of people throughout the play (Duncan: (2.2.19)Banquo: (3.1.129-135) Macduff’s family: (4.2.96-98)) who’s deaths all participate
      in causing Macbeth’s downfall. Since there are many times where Macbeth makes the ignorant error of killing someone, there is not one particular fatal flaw leading to his downfall. Since one single fatal flaw is a key property of a story with a
      tragic hero and in Macbeth, Macbeth does not have a single flaw that leads to his demise, Shakespeare does not portray Macbeth as a tragic hero. When Ross reveals to Macduff that his family had been murdered, Malcolm eventually responds with,
      “Be comforted. /Let's make us med’cines of our great revenge, /To cure this deadly grief.” (4.3.252-254) Malcolm realizes that Macduff is a victim of evil and of a “deadly greif.” Since this act was so harmful to Macduff and his family, the
      person who committed the act is evil and deserving of “great revenge.” As readers, it is known that Macbeth has killed Macduff’s family. This is an example of Shakespeare showing that without a doubt, Macbeth is evil and ruthless. A side effect
      of Macbeth being evil is ignorantly killing people, which happened to lead to his downfall. Macbeth’s demise is caused by killing people, but it only exists as a mere side effect of Macbeth being nothing but a ruthless, evil antihero. </p>
    <p>It is very clear that throughout the play, through the juxtaposition of Macbeth’s character development, characteristics congruent to ones of an antihero, and evidence showing that Macbeth cannot be good in any way, Macbeth is portrayed not
      only an antihero, but is an evil person. He is seen throughout the play as changing into someone truly evil. There are many examples of how people in history change from someone who is not an evil person to someone who is; one example is how
      Adolf Hitler was once an artist who wanted to share his thought provoking ideas. Later in his life, he turned purely evil exterminating an entire population, killing many innocent people in bombings, and creating a country that was dangerous
      for event the most loyal Nazi. People can always change, so all one must do is be observant and supportive and a life can steer away from evil.</p>
